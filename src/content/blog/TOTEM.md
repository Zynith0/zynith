A few weeks ago, I built a keyboard called the TOTEM. It's a 38 key split keyboard with low profile switches.
It also has a splayed layout, which I've never tried before. I've also actually never tried choc/low profile switches before now that I think about it.

This keyboard is incredibly comfortable, and it's my first time ever *really* trying home row mods.
Home row mods are where when you hold down a certain key on the home row, it acts as a different one. So for example,
whenever I hold down F or J, they act as shift. This allows me to type capital letters without my fingers ever leaving the home row.
I do sometimes accidentally activate the home row mods when I'm typing though, as I'm still getting used to them.

I think I did a kinda decent soldering job, as everything worked first try except for two keys, which I have yet to fix.
